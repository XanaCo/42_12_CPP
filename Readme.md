## Overview

The `CPP Piscine` project series is a rigorous exploration of C++ programming. In these projects, students are tasked with implementing various concepts of C++, ranging from basic syntax and data types to advanced topics like polymorphism, exception handling, and design patterns.

The `CPP Piscine` projects are a crucial step in understanding object-oriented programming, C++ syntax, and software design principles. They require implementing core features such as class design, operator overloading, inheritance, and memory management.

## Modules

1. **Module 00**: This module covers the basics of C++ programming, including namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff. It lays the foundation for understanding C++ syntax and semantics.

2. **Module 01**: This module delves into memory management in C++, covering topics like memory allocation, pointers to members, and references. It also introduces the switch statement for control flow.

3. **Module 02**: This module introduces ad-hoc polymorphism and operator overloading, allowing for more intuitive interfaces for class objects. It also covers the Orthodox Canonical class form, a standard form for classes in C++.

4. **Module 03**: This module is all about inheritance, a key concept in object-oriented programming. It teaches how to create a hierarchy of classes, allowing for more organized and maintainable code.

5. **Module 04**: This module covers subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. These concepts allow for a unified interface for different classes, increasing code flexibility and reusability.

6. **Module 05**: This module focuses on repetition and exceptions. It covers how to manage errors during program execution using exception handling, and how to use repetition structures effectively.

7. **Module 06**: This module introduces C++ casts, which are used to convert one type to another. It covers static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast.

8. **Module 07**: This module is all about C++ templates. It covers how to use templates to write generic code that works with different data types, increasing code reusability and efficiency.

9. **Module 08**: This module delves into templated containers, iterators, and algorithms. It covers how to use these tools to solve complex problems more efficiently.

10. **Module 09**: This module covers the Standard Template Library (STL), a powerful library in C++ that provides several generic classes and functions. This includes containers, algorithms, and iterators.

## Key Skills Developed
